# Tech Degree Project 2/ Liist Pagination and Filtering
Rosio Dorson
 
The goal of the second project in the Tech Degree program is to learn the skills of list pagination and filtering. I was provided with a web page that has 54 student names, photos and emails that need to be separated into lists. Each page should contain 10 students information, using JavaScript I'll be able to let the user click through the links at the bottom of the page to vew 10 students at a time. In this project I'll be using the principle of "progressive enhancement" which will allow the page to display correctly without JavaScript being required to us the web page. My project works with any different number of students and not only the 54 student infoormattion provided.
